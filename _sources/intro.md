# The Data Science Labs on Differential and Integral Calculus
**By Alden Bradford and Mireille Boutin with Kindyl King and Naazneen Rana**

Welcome to MA16290, The Data Science Labs on Differential and Integral Calculus! This is a one credit course to accompany Calculus 2, during which you will discover applications of differential and integral calculus to data science. You will also learn to program in Python and to use Arduino sensors and microprocessors to acquire data. This course is intended to be taken in tangent with Calculus 2 and participating will allow you to earn honors credit for Calculus 2.

This course requires no work outside of the lab, including no homework, no quizzes, no tests, and no exams. All work is performed during the 150 minutes spent in the lab each week. Calculus 1 is a pre-requisite and Calculus 2 is a co-requisite for taking this course.

Fall 2022 schedule:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Wednesday 5:30-8:00 P.M. CRN 25496
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Thursday 5:30-8:00 P.M. CRN 26495

## How to Get Started

One of the primary applications you'll be using throughout this course is Jupyter Notebook, which is what you are currently reading this on. In Jupyter, you can access and edit files, including code. To navigate between files, click the folder icon in the top left corner of this site. There, you will see the file directory. To find the labs for this class, navigate to *labs* where you will find folders containing the labs and other files, such as the pictures used in the Notebook and code that will be employed during the labs.

Another useful feature is the Table of Contents (also referred to as the TOC). This can be seen by clicking the bullet point icon in the top left corner, 2 icons under the folder icon. This tool can help you navigate quickly to certain parts of the labs, such as specific sections or exercises. 

To get started with this course, click the next arrow at the bottom left of this page to get to Lab 1. This lab will explain how to interact with the Notebook, including running code, editing cells, and other useful features that can be used in Jupyter. To begin editing this lab, ?
