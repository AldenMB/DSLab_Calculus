    "Today we will begin using numbers collected from the real world. Every number you measure is subject to several kinds of error from different sources. This is the first and most important lesson of error analysis: *every measurement has error. The goal is not to eliminate error, but rather to reduce it to an acceptable level.* As we progress through the semester, we will develop strong tools for analyzing and reducing error in our measurements, based off of differential calculus and Taylor series. Before we can do that, we need to establish some common language and techniques for describing errors."

    "### Types of error\n",
    "\n",
    "An error is anything which can make it so that the number you get is different from the actual value of the quantity you are measuring. Here are a few sources of error you are likely to encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    " - measurement error. This is what most people think of when they hear about an error in measurement. This includes everything which could go wrong with your measurement instrument. Perhaps the marks on a ruler are not placed exactly evenly, or it isn't being held straight. Perhaps the paralax on a measurement dial leads to misalignment between the needle and the dial. Perhaps your tool is low on batteries and is malfunctioning. \n",
    " - roundoff error. Also called truncation error. This is where a number is off a little bit because it was rounded. For example, Alden's favorite pocket calculator the TI-30Xa only keeps 14 digits of $\\pi$. If you needed $\\pi$ to any further precision, you would have to use a different calculator. Usually the cure for this source of error is fairly simple -- just keep more digits! However, this is not always practical: maybe you are using numbers someone else has rounded and cannot access the original data, or maybe keeping enough digits for your task would be too cumbersome. We will see some examples in a few weeks, when we study numerical differentiation, where roundoff error becomes really important.\n",
    " - modeling error. Every computation is based on a model, and every model is inaccurate. For example, suppose you want to measure the volume of the earth. You could perform astronomical measurements to figure out the radius of the earth, and use the volume formula for a sphere, $\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$ to figure out the volume. The formula is perfect, without error, provided you are talking about a true sphere. As anyone knows, however, the earth is not a perfect sphere (it has mountains, for one thing). Therefore, there is some error associated with modeling the earth as a perfect sphere, which will affect your final volume computation.\n",
    " - definitional error. This is perhaps the most frequently overlooked source of error, and its definition gets a bit philosophical. Usually we can't get to a level where it is important in the physical sciences, though it is frequently important in the social sciences. As an example, consider the old unit of length, the barleycorn. This is still used today to measure shoe sizes. Its definition could not be simpler: it's the length of a grain of barley, roughly 1/3 of an inch or 8.5 millimeters. There is a problem here though: barley has some natural variablility of size, from 6.4 millimeters at the smallest to 13 millimeters at the longest [(see this study if you want to know more about barley)](https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/10118.pdf). So, depending on which type of barley you are using, your shoe could wind up being a bad fit. It's not a matter of the barley being a bad tool for measuring length in barleycorns: you can always tell exactly how long something is in barleycorns by lining up a row of barley, and you will be correct by definition. It's a problem with the definition of the length unit -- the definition has some error built in. This usually doesn't affect us when making distance measurements, since we have better definitions now for length, based off the speed of light and our definition of time. However, for very sensitive measurements, it is still sometimes an issue. Furthermore, for more abstractly defined quantities (such as intelligence, or anxiety, or pain) the definition still has a significant amount of error built in which can sometimes be the biggest source of error in a computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a relatively simple taxonomy of errors, but it encompasses most of the important sources of error you are likely to encounter. If you can think of a source of error which does not fit this taxonomy, we would like to hear about it (email mboutin at purdue dot you know what). As we will see, you could waste a lot of effort reducing the error from one source only to find that a different source is introducing way more error, making your efforts fruitless. Therefore, it is important to be aware of how each source of error could creep in.\n",

    "### Two ways errors behave\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually represent error with a variable either as $e$ (short for error), or in Greek with the lower case letter epsilon which makes the same sound, written as either $\\epsilon$ or $\\varepsilon$. This lets us represent how any measured quantity $x$ is related to its \"true value\" $t$:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x = t + \\varepsilon.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "This is sometimes called *the most famous equation of measurement theory*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random error\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is usually to make the total error small. For some types of error, $\\varepsilon$ is on average zero; the error is just as often positive as it is negative. A consequence of this is that if you took lots and lots of measurements (say $x_1=t+\\varepsilon_1$, $x_2=t+\\varepsilon_2$, $\\dots$, $x_k=t+\\varepsilon_k$) then you could take the average \n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\frac{x_1+x_2+\\dots+x_k}{k} = t + \\frac{\\varepsilon_1+\\varepsilon_2+\\dots+\\varepsilon_k}{k}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "and the term $\\frac{\\varepsilon_1+\\varepsilon_2+\\dots+\\varepsilon_k}{k}$ would tend to be much smaller than each $\\varepsilon_i$ on its own, since the positive and negative terms would mostly cancel each other out. This is really useful, since it gives us a way of reducing the total error, getting a better estimate of the value $t$. If this is the case, we say that the error in $x$ is *random*. This technique for reducing random error [was invented in the 1700s.](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~bradfoa/misc_files/arithmetic_mean.pdf) (See  for example page 121 of \"Studies in the History of Statistics and Probability,\" by M.G. Kendall, 1960.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Systematic error\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we are often not so lucky as to only have random error. Very often there is some bias in our measurement which causes it to be usually positive or usually negative, so it does not help much to use the repeated measurement procedure described above. In this case we say there is a *systematic* error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you decide to save some computer cycles in a computation by truncating your numbers -- instead of rounding (which could take some additional time, depending on how your computer is set up) you decide to just drop the least significant digits. The effect of this is that you will always be making the number smaller. It's just like if you always decided to round down. In the terms outlined above, $\\varepsilon$ is always negative in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, suppose you are weighing precise amounts of material in a chemistry lab on a sensitive scale, but you don't have a cover over the scale and there is a slight downdraft at the work bench. You are leaning over the scale when you hit the tare button, shielding the scale from the air current. The air would push down on the scale a bit during the weighting, causing your estimated weight $x$ to usually be a little bit bigger than $t$. It would still vary randomly, but since $\\varepsilon$ would usually be positive we would say that this is a systematic error in the positive direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color:red;\"> Exercise 2 </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "For each source of error described, classify it as a random or a systematic error. If it is a systematic error, say whether it is in the positive or negative direction. Justify your answers with a brief sentence or two.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are measuring your height against a wall by placing a book on your head and seeing where the book touches the wall, measuring the length along the wall from the floor with a tape measure. Unfortunately, you cannot guarantee that the book is completely level.\n",
