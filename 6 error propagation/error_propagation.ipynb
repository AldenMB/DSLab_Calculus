    "## accuracy and precision\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's establish some shared terminology. The distiction between random and systematic errors is often phrased in terms of how accurate a measurement is and how precise a measurement is. Professional scientists and engineers use the words \"accuracy\" and \"precision\" to refer to two different, related concepts. *Accuracy* refers to how close the measurement is to the true value. *Precision* refers to how close repeated measurements are to each other. This is summarized in teh following image -- in this metaphor the arrows are our measurements, and the target is the true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=accuracy_and_precision.png width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terms described above, a measurement is accurate if $|\\varepsilon|$ is small. A measurement is precise if it is close to the average value. It follows that the accuracy can only be as good as the precision, so we often do want to have good precision. However, as the picture shows, it is possible (and indeed, common) to have lots of precision but not much accuracy. In that case, the precision isn't really doing you any good. The real goal is accuracy. Don't lose sight of that!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Two ways of reporting errors\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been talking about the error $\\varepsilon$ directly. This is also called the *absolute error*. This term has nothing to do with absolute value. Absolute error can be positive or negative. The units of absolute error are the same as the units of the measured quantity. A typical ruler has markings down to the 1/16 inch, so interpolating by eye you can make sure the error is less than 1/32 inches. This can be very good for measuring, say, how long your pencil is, since a typical pencil is around 7 inches long. The pencil on my desk is 7 1/8 inches long, $\\pm$1/32 inch. I use the symbol $\\pm$ to indicate that I don't know whether my guess is too high or too low. All I can say for sure is\n",

    "7\\frac{1}{8} -\\frac{1}{32}< t < 7\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{32}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A ruler like this would not be as appropriate for measuring how wide the pencil is -- it can only tell me it is 1/4 inch wide, $\\pm$1/32 inch. To express this idea mathematically, we simply divide the error by the true value -- or if we don't know the true value, by our best guess. We write this as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\eta = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{t} \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon}{x}, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "using the greek letter eta ($\\eta$) which also makes an \"e\" sound, though it looks sort of like a lowercase n. This quantity is called the relative error. Unlike the absolute error, the relative error is dimensionless -- it would be the same if we expresed the answer in inches or centimeters or smoots. Relative error is usually expressed as a percentage. For example, the length of my pencil is 7 1/8 inches $\\pm$ 0.44%. The width of my pencil is 1/4 inch $\\pm$ 12.5%. This shows how a ruler is not appropriate for measuring the width of a pencil, but it's fine for measuring the length -- the relative error is significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often want an equation relating $t$ and $x$ using the relative error instead of the absolute error. This is easily achieved by factoring:\n",

    "Most calculations we do involve more than one number. Each number has its own error associated with it. As an example, suppose I measure the length of one pencil to be $x_1$, and another to be $x_2$ inches long. How long will they be together, put end to end? $y = x_1+x_2$, of course. How will the errors relate to each other? They will also add together. We can see this in a formula:\n",

    "\n",
    "The answer is of the form $y+\\varepsilon_{total}$, where the total error is $\\varepsilon_{total}=\\varepsilon_1+\\varepsilon_2$. So, when adding quantities with error, the absolute errors should add together. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not such a tidy formula. There are a couple things we can do to make it easy on ourselves, though. For one thing, in any reasonable computation, the error is much smaller than the actual quantity being measured. It follows that the product of two errors should be much, much smaller than the product of the two quantities. Symbolically, we can write this as $\\varepsilon_1\\varepsilon_2<<x_1x_2$. So, we should be safe ignoring that term in the equation:\n",

    "It should be noted that not all numbers carry errors with them. Consider, for example, the formula for the area of a sphere, $V=4\\pi r^2$. Presumably when you measure the radius, that will involve some error. Also, since $\\pi$ is irrational, we can only approximate it so there would be error associated with it as well. however, 4 is a pure number. So there would only be two potential sources of error in computing the surface area of a sphere: error in your approximation for $\\pi$ and error in your measured radius.\n",

Very small indeed, but not zero. In a later lab (once you have learned about Taylor series) we will discuss how to treat errors in this case. In the mean time, beware!
