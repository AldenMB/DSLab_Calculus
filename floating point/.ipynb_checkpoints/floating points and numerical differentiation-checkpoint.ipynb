We don't have an infinite amount of memory available on our computers, so Python only stores 53 binary digits, which introduces roundoff error. The relative error is at most $2^{-53} = 1.11\\times 10^{-16}$, so numbers are not reliable beyond sixteen places. Sure enough, in the exmaple above, we got an error sixteen places after the 3."
