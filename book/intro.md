# The Data Science Labs on Differential and Integral Calculus
**By Alden Bradford and Mireille Boutin with Kindyl King and Naazneen Rana**

Welcome to MA16290, The Data Science Labs on Differential and Integral Calculus! This is a one credit course to accompany Calculus 2, during which you will discover applications of differential and integral calculus to data science. You will also learn to program in Python and to use Arduino sensors and microprocessors to acquire data. This course is intended to be taken in tangent with Calculus 2 and participating will allow you to earn honors credit for Calculus 2.

This course requires no work outside of the lab, including no homework, no quizzes, no tests, and no exams. All work is performed during the 150 minutes spent in the lab each week. Calculus 1 is a pre-requisite and Calculus 2 is a co-requisite for taking this course.

Fall 2022 offering:
