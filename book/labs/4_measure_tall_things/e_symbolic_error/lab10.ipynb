We do that with the `^` and `_` keys (caret and underscore). **Watch out**: Latex is different from Python. In Python, we would write $x^2$ as `x**2`. It can be easy to get mixed up when switching back and forth.\n",

We use the `{` and `}` symbols (braces) to group things together in Latex. I can type this instead as `x^{23}` which gives $x^{23}$.\n",
