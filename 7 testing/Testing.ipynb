    "## Choosing good tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people get so excited about automatic testing that they make 20 tests for every function, by just running every example they can think of. This is not a good strategy because it makes too many tests to keep track of; when something goes wrong it's not clear why, and if a change has to be made then you have to change it in lots of places. Plus, there is no guarantee that a collection of tests formed in this way will actually cover every important case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some guidelines you can follow to make good tests:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Each test should test for just one thing -- when it fails, it should be clear why.\n",
    " - If there is a way that you use your function, your should test its behavior in that way. For example, if you use your function on floating point numbers, you should test it on floating point numbers.\n",
    " - If there is something the function does which is not obvious or unexpected, write a test which demonstrates it.\n",
    " - If you find a bug, write a test which demonstrates it, then fix the bug. (If it wasn't obvious to you when you wrote the function, it won't be obvious to whoever is reading it!)\n",

    "It may surprise you to learn this, but that is frequently backwards from how people actually use autmated testing. In the paradigm called **test-driven design**, you write tests first, and then compose code so that it passes the tests. In this way, the tests act like a kind of checklist. When your code passes its tests, you know it is done.\n",

    "# Hardware testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is essential for troubleshooting. Often, the things we are troubleshooting are electronic circuits. We can apply the same types of automated testing to electronic circuits to make sure they are working as expected. In many circuit fabrication plants, this is done to every circuit board they make since it is so easy to do and it improves trust in the products.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you do when one of the tests shows a problem? You start testing individual components. Suppose for a minute that you have an antique Commodore 64 computer, and it is not working. One of the most common problems the Commodore 64 faced [was faulty glue logic chips](https://dfarq.homeip.net/mos-74ls-logic-chips/).  One of the first things you can check is whether those chips are working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could check them manually: put the chip onto a breadboard and start checking all the possible ways the circuit can be used. This could take a while, either because there are lots of conditions which need to be tested, or because you have lots of chips to test. Why not automate this?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what you will do for the remainder of the lab: build a tool based on the Raspberry Pi Pico to test glue-logic chips and identify faults.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is glue logic?\n",
    "\n",
    "The 7400 series of chips are used to produce electrical signals which are modified versions of ones only available. For example, suppose you have amachine which is prone to overheating. You decide to power it with a thermostant which cuts the power when its heat gets too high. When the thermostat is delivering a high signal, your device keeps going along quietly. When the temperature gets too high the thermostat cuts the power to the device, bringing its control signal low. What if you also want to turn on a fan, to cool the device off? You could use the chip 7504, which takes a signal which is either high or low, and gives the reverse. This is called a `not` gate because it is the same as the logical expression `not` -- false becomes true, true becomes false. It is called \"glue logic\" because you can use it to \"glue together\" components which accept different types of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 7400 series chips for most of the popular functions from formal logic: `and`, `or`, `nand`, `nor`, `xor`, `xnor`, and of course `not`. Each chip provides several copies of the logic gate. You have to look at the data sheet for each chip to know what gates are connected to which pins. The data sheet also comes with a table explaining what the logic gate does for each possible input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your task\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been supplied a variety of 7400 series chips. One is a working 7408 `and` chip, another is a broken 7408. The rest are other chips from the 7400 series. Three of them have had their labels sanded off, and replaced with a letter in whiteout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a tool which can tell you whether each chip is working, and if it is working then what type of chip. For example, if you connect a working 7402 `nor` chip, your tool should tell you as much. If you connect a broken chip, or one which does not match any of the 7400 series chips, your tool should say it is a broken or unknown chip. You can do this with the digital input/output capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico, setting each of the possible combinations of inputs and checking against the possible outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A word of caution\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of this tool is that you should be able to connect it to an untrustworthy chip. That means that even if the data sheet says that a pin should be an input, for example, you should assume it might be outputting a high voltage or shorting to ground. In order to protect your tool, therefore, you should connect each pin to the microcontroller through a 10k$\\Omega$ resistor. This will allow a data signal through, but prevent any part from drawing or supplying too much current. If you are unsure whether you have it connected safely, ask your TA."
