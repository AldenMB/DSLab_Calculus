    "An inclinometer is a device for measuring the angle between a sight line and the horizon. For lab 8, you will need an inclinometer which you can use outdoors, not connected to a computer. Here are some requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    " - it should run on battery power alone\n",
    " - it should have a display which you can read, telling you the components of acceleration\n",
    " - it should have a \"hold\" button, which freezes the display while pressed so that a reading can be made\n",
    "\n",
    "The cheapest inclinometer on Amazon which meets these requirements costs about 30 dollars. Can we do better? If we spend 4 dollars on a Raspberry Pi Pico, 4 dollars on an OLED display, 3 dollars on an accelerometer chip and 3 dollars on a 9 volt battery with a holder, that leaves us 16 dollars to buy wires and a case. Not bad! Plus, ours will be more customizable -- we could easily add features down the road, if we want them."

    "# The screen\n",
    "\n",
    "## I2C\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually a modern electronic device will consist of a *microcontroller* (such as the Raspberry Pi Pico) and several *peripherals*. Peripherals are what we call any component the microcontroller is \"in charge\" of. The two main peripherals we will be using in our inclinometer are a screen and an accelerometer. You might call the button a peripheral, but usually the word peripheral refers to components which do something on their own, while communicating with the microcontroller.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular ways for a microcontroller to communicate with a peripheral is using a protocol called the Inter-Integrated-Circuit protocol. Its name is usually abbreviated, either as IIC, IÂ²C, or simply I2C. These are pronounced as \"eye-eye-see\", \"eye-squared-see\" or \"eye-two-see\" respectively. I2C uses two wires, one called Serial Clock (abbreviated as SCL) and the other called Serial Data (abbreviated SDA). One of the brilliant things about I2C is that every I2C peripheral has its own identification number, so when a message is sent using the I2C protocol it can have a label saying \"who it is for\". That means you can have several different peripherals all connected to the same two wires -- potentially connecting dozens of peripherals to a microcontroller using only two wires (assuming none of the devices share an identification number). Since many devices are sharing the share the same connection an I2C connection is called a \"bus\", from the Latin *Omnibus* which means \"for everyone\". I2C is an example of a *serial* communication protocol, because bits of data are sent one after another (in a series) over relatively few wires, instead of all-at-once over relatively many wires. You have already heard of, and used, another serial bus protocol -- the so-called Universal Serial Bus, usually abbreviated as USB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Raspberry Pi Pico has two I2C busses, numbered 0 and 1. You can see which pins they are connected to on the Pico's datasheet; for example, to use I2C bus number 0, you can use any of the GP pins labeled as I2C0 SCL and I2C0 SDA. You might choose GP pins 20 and 21, or 12 and 13, or 4 and 5 for a few examples. When you set up an I2C bus, you will have to choose a frequency for it to use. This is a fairly straightforward decision. The valid choices of frequency are 100,000; 400,000; 1,000,000; 1,700,000; and 3,400,000 Hertz. If you use a higher frequency then your system will run faster and consume more power. Higher frequencies might not work, depending on several factors such as how long your wires are and how much electromagnetic interference they experience. Also, some peripherals are not compatible with higher frequencies. In a situation like ours, where we are not particularly concerned with power consumption, it makes sense to choose the highest frequency possible so that you system runs faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The framebuffer\n",
    "\n",
    "On the hardware side, we interact with the OLED display using I2C. In software, the interface we will use is one of the interfaces built into Micropython: the frame buffer interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called a frame buffer because when interacting with it, you make most of your changes in an array called a buffer, stored on the Pico. We only send data to the display when we call the function `show()`, as a complete frame ready to display. This way, we are using the I2C bus as little as possible, freeing up time for other peripherals to use the I2C bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for the frame buffer interface is [part of the Micropython documentation](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/framebuf.html). There you will find functions for drawing lines, rectangles, and text, as well as a function for writing to individual pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Three clocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the easiest way to learn a new tool is to see it used. As an example, we have provided three programs which do the same thing using the OLED display. `procedural_clock.py` draws a clock on the display by performing a sequence of actions one after another, inside a `while True` loop. `classy_clock.py` does the exact same steps, but wraps everything to do with the display into one class and defines methods on the class to do the various parts. `grandfather_clock.py` is almost identical to `classy_clock.py`, but it uses inheritance, hence the name. Note that in practice you would usually define any classes you are using in a separate module, and import those classes into your main file. We have chosen to put the class definition at the bottom of the file to make it easier for you to compare them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of what they do, the three programs are identical. Their difference lies in how easy they are to read and how easy they are to modify.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why does this help us to make an inclinometer? An inclinometer is usually held very still to make a measurement; it's not accelerating. Naively, we might think an accelerometer would tell us nothing about a stationary object, except that it is stationary. As it turns out, that naive view is incorrect because of general relativity. As it turns out, the effect of gravity also shows up in our measurements as an acceleration. If you wish to learn more about this, you can see [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAtRD9_4Oa0) which has helpful animations, or [this more impassioned video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vng2-R64rAY) from a professional physicist who presents the limits of this interpretation of gravity. For our purpose, it is enough to know that if the accelerometer is being held still, it will indicate the direction of gravity. By angling our accelerometer toward a target, we can find the angle between the target and vertical.\n",
